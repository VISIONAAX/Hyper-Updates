# Hyper Updates

**A secure, decentralized, and tamper-proof software updates system using Avalanche HyperSDK, revolutionizing firmware delivery for IoT devices with transparency, reliability, and scalability.**

### **Inspiration**
Hyper Updates was inspired by the growing need for a secure and tamper-proof system to manage software updates. Leveraging **Avalanche HyperSDK**, the project redefines firmware and software update distribution by building a private blockchain network tailored for IoT devices such as ESP32 and Arduino. By integrating **IPFS**, Hyper Updates ensures decentralized and immutable storage, addressing inefficiencies and risks posed by traditional centralized systems. 

This project aligns with the hackathon’s goals by showcasing the full potential of Avalanche’s technology stack to solve real-world problems while promoting innovation, scalability, and trust within decentralized ecosystems.

### **What It Does**
Hyper Updates builds a cutting-edge firmware and software update system by:

1. **Private Blockchain Network**:
   - **Hyper Updates VM**: Developed using Avalanche HyperSDK, this VM serves as the backbone for securely storing metadata for updates, such as update name, version, firmware binary hash, and IPFS URL.

2. **Seamless IoT Update System**:
   - **Vendor Service**:
     - A Next.js-powered UI allows vendors to register updates and upload firmware binaries to IPFS via the **Updates CLI**, making updates easily accessible.
   - **IoT Devices**:
     - IoT devices (e.g., ESP32) autonomously fetch updates using the **HyperOTA library**, verifying integrity with blockchain-stored metadata.

3. **Decentralized and Immutable**:
   - Firmware binaries are stored on IPFS, ensuring tamper-proof and resilient data storage.
   - Devices can seamlessly revert to the previous stable firmware if validation fails.

4. **Reliable and Automated Rollbacks**:
   - Robust rollback mechanisms ensure system stability in the event of a failed update.
   - MQTT notifications alert IoT devices about available updates, streamlining update distribution.

This innovation aligns with **Build a Product**, **Advanced Technical Development**, and **Interoperability** tracks by showcasing real-world blockchain use cases and advanced technical capabilities.
